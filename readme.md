## Notes In Deep Reinforcement Learning

 Notes of DRL, here is the brief introduction of these documents:<br>
* **Basic Idea in DRL** (Finished) :  This is the first chapter for beginner to know what is Reinforcement Learning including `value-based` model and `policy-based` model.
* **Applications in DRL**: some applications with DRL technique. 
	* COMA (Updating) : COMA is a RL method which used to play StarCraft Game, you can see the main idea in here: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/51858687. It concludes 3 papers: `Learn to communicate`ï¼Œ`Counterfactual policy gradients` and `Experience Replay`.
	* Play Honor of Kings with DRL (Finished) : a paper about controlling AI to play Honor of Kings with DRL proposed by Tencent AI Lab.
	
* **Recurrent Neural Network** (Finished) : Basic ideas about RNN which is the important technique to solve the partial observation problem.
